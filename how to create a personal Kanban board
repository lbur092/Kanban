    Write your tasks on thin, short strips of paper. Add a deadline if they have one. These are your Kanban cards. 
    On a piece of paper, draw a table with three columns, ensuring they are long enough to fit your pending tasks.
    Add three headers: 'To do', 'Doing', 'Done'.
    Set WIP limit in the 'Doing' column by drawing a horizontal line.
    Mark any priority tasks with a star.
    Move tasks across from left to right as you complete them, always aiming to fill empty spaces. Make sure you prioritize tasks with the red star.
